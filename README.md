My little sister is an HR manager in a a club. She has the task of preparing Certificates for nearly 60 people who had attended an event.
I saw her writing their names one by one in canva, She has their names on a paper.
So, I created a streamlit application for her to automize this task using python, and it took me less time to do it than it would've taken her to prepare them. it contains:
1- a module to recognizes the names on the paper
2- an interface where she can upload the file 
3- a python script that will open the url design and replace the name in the certificate.
Install the requirements and try it yourself.   Enjoy!
